# Reference — MSP Tutor Registration (2026/2027)

Curated background/context for the tutor-registration tool, distilled from the
MSP office's working archive. The archive itself is ~2,600 files (registration
exports, emails, old years) and is **not** committed; this folder keeps only the
slim, current, decision-useful slice for **academic year 2026/2027**.

Everything here is either a clean Markdown/CSV distillation (readable on GitHub,
usable as context) or a small set of canonical source PDFs.

## Contents

| File | What it is | Feeds / relates to |
|---|---|---|
| [`course-catalogue-2026-2027.md`](course-catalogue-2026-2027.md) / `.csv` | All 142 courses & skills by discipline + period, with pre-/co-requisites. "Course" = has tutorial groups (tutor-relevant); "Skill" = PRA practical. | The course list & prerequisites shown on the register page (`course` table, `details` JSONB). |
| [`coordinators-2026-2027.md`](coordinators-2026-2027.md) / `.csv` | 81 course coordinators → UM email. | `coordinator` / `coordinator_email` fields when adding/maintaining courses. |
| [`frame-schedule-2026-2027.md`](frame-schedule-2026-2027.md) | The 5 fixed weekly slots + standard teaching time blocks + period dates. | The Mon–Fri timetable and time-clash logic on the register page. |
| [`tutoring-procedures.md`](tutoring-procedures.md) | How the course-registration → scheduling → tutor-allocation cycle works, who's eligible, how tutors are sourced. | Context for maintaining the tool / onboarding. |
| `Info for tutor registration tool.xlsx` | Tutorial groups, days & times (Fall P1/P2). | Source for `seed.sql` / `demo-data.js` — the live catalogue. |
| [`originals/`](originals/) | Canonical source PDFs (see below). | Authoritative fallback for the distilled files. |

### `originals/`

- `2026-2027 MSP Course Catalogue May 2026.pdf` — full course descriptions,
  objectives, literature, assessment, GenAI policy. The up-to-date catalogue
  (supersedes earlier April 2026 drafts).
- `Frame schedule MSP 2026-2027 Period 1/2/4/5 - Final.pdf` — authoritative
  per-course slot allocations (which course is in which slot) + coordinators.
- `Pre-corequisites overview 2026-2027 P1 and P2 April 2026.pdf` — source for the
  Fall prerequisite columns.
- `Switch and withdraw deadlines Academic Year 2026 2027.pdf` — student
  switch/withdraw deadlines.

## How this maps to the tool

The tool's live catalogue is generated from two source files kept in this folder:
`Info for tutor registration tool.xlsx` (tutorial groups, days, times → currently
Fall P1/P2 only, the 12 active courses / 117 groups) and the catalogue PDF in
`originals/` (course detail). **This folder is the supporting reference** for that data: the
full catalogue beyond the active 12, the coordinator→email lookup, the slot
system behind the timetable, and the office workflow the tool fits into.

## Updating for a new year

The distilled files were generated from the office archive's `2026-2027` folders:
`Course Catalogue/Course overview`, `Pre and Corequisites Overview`,
`Course Information/Course Coordinators…`, the frame-schedule PDFs, and
`Procedures/`. For a new year, re-run the same extraction against the new year's
equivalents and replace these files.

## Provenance & privacy

Sources are internal MSP office documents. Only **course-level** information is
included here (course codes, titles, coordinators' work emails, schedules,
procedures) — no student data, no registration exports, no private correspondence
from the archive.
